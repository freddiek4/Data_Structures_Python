File Name: Problem 1
Description: program uses stack to determine whether inputs are palindromes
Author: Freddie Kiessling

'''

## Write a program that uses a stack to test input strings to determine whether they are palindromes. A palindrome is a sequence of words that reads the same as the sequence in reverse: for example, noon.

class Stack:
	
	#TODO: Remove the "pass" statements and implement each method
	#Add any methods if necesssary
	#DON'T use any builtin stack class to store your items
	
	def __init__(self): # Constructor function
		self.items = []
	def isEmpty(self): # Returns True if the stack is empty or False otherwise
		return self.items == []
	def len(self): # Returns the number of items in the stack
		return len(self.items)
	def peek(self): # Returns the item at the top of the stack
		return self.items[-1]
	def push(self, item): # Adds item to the top of the stack
		self.items.append(item)
	def pop(self): # Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack
		return self.items.pop()
	
	
def palindrome(input_string):
	isPalindrome = False
	#todo: Your work here
	
	# since spaces are of no interest we use the isalnum function to check
	# for alphanumeric characters and then we use the join function as well 
	# to exclude all spaces. This way we get the input in a single string
	input_string = "".join(i for i in input_string if i.isalnum()).lower()
	
	my_stack = Stack() # creates a stack
	for i in input_string:
		my_stack.push(i) # adds each character of the input string to the stack
		
	isPalindrome = True
	#The for loop iterates through the input string that has no spaces now.
	#Each iteration it compares the ith character of the string to the top
	#character of the Stack function 
	for i in input_string:
		if i != my_stack.pop():
			isPalindrome = False
			break
		
	# Return if input_str is palindrome or not
	return isPalindrome



if __name__ == "__main__":
	my_str = "racecar "
	print(palindrome(my_str)) # Correct Output: True
	#todo (optional): Your testing code here

Functions associated with stack:

Stack data structure follows the last in first out data (LIFO) format
		- first element added to the stack will be at the bottom
		- last element added to the stack will be at the top 

1. push(item): Adds an item to the top of the stack.
2. pop(): Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack.
3. peek(): Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
4. isEmpty(): Returns True if the stack is empty, and False otherwise.
5. len(): Returns the number of items in the stack.
6. isFull(): Returns True if the stack is full, and False otherwise (applies only to fixed-size stacks).
7. clear(): Removes all the items from the stack.
8. copy(): Returns a copy of the stack.
9. search(item): Returns the 1-based position of the item in the stack, with the top element being position 1.

Description: The method expects an integer index as an argument. Then it removes and return the item in the queue at that position.

#   When you send a file to be printed on a shared printer, it is put onto a print queue with other jobs. Anytime before your job prints, you can access the queue to remove it. Thus, some queues support a remove operation. Add this method to the queue implementations. The method should expect an integer index as an argument. It should then remove and return the item in the queue at that position (counting from position 0 at the front to position n â€“ 1 at the rear).

1. Queues are linear collections. 
2. Insertions are restricted to one end, called the rear, and removals to the other end, called the front. 
3. A queue thus supports a first-in first-out (FIFO) protocol
